# festival_App

Hello everyone!
We are the Festivaleurs.

We are a challegue for this first hackathon: make a application React with a API with the theme of music in only 24 hours.

We are a idea: sometimes you want to go in a musical festival but yours friends are not free for this date. So we want create a application for searching the festival and some friends to go together.


Thank you to Wild Code School and my Challenge Team for this good project.
